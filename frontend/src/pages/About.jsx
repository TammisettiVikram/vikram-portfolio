            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                I’m a backend-focused full-stack developer who enjoys designing
                scalable APIs, authentication systems, and clean data models.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                I primarily work with Flask and Django on the backend, PostgreSQL
                for data storage, and React for building simple but effective
                dashboards and internal tools.
            </p>

            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                I care about clean architecture, security, and writing code that
                can grow with real-world usage.
            </p>
